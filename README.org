* Alakazam

Alakazam is my config for Hammerspoon as well as the home of my Spoons. Cloning
this repo into =~/.hammerspoon/= is enough to get this started. In theory the
config will bootstrap itself from there, thanks to my =spoonManager= spoon.

The best way to use individual spoons is probably to directly copy
=spoonManager= into your own Hammerspoon config (or use another spoon management
tool that can handle git repos), and then from there you'll want to grab the zip
file releases of my individual spoons that you wish to use.

** To-Dos
*** TODO add zip releases in GH for individual spoons
